Dumping site management software Main objective : Develop a mobile algorithm to optimize door-to-door waste collection by streamlining routes and minimizing inefficiencies, thereby reducing dependence on dumping sites. The algorithm would use real-time data on waste levels, traffic conditions, and vehicle capacities to generate efficient collection schedules and routes. It would ensure that collection vehicles operate at maximum capacity while minimizing fuel consumption and travel time. By integrating GPS tracking and machine learning, the algorithm can adapt to changes in waste patterns and adjust routes dynamically. This approach enhances efficiency, reduces environmental impact, and prevents the formation of illegal dumping sites due to uncollected waste.
